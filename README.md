## **DEVELOPERS**:

This section is for anybody who wants to add a rarity to any of their custom items through code, it's pretty simple - you just have to follow what's below. However, if you are currently using the **[ModComponent SDK](https://github.com/Deaadman/ModComponentSDK)** then you'll be better off using the integrated functionality as seen **[here]()**.

If you have a mod that already contains some code, you'll need to install the **[NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/ItemRarities)** package into your project. After doing so, it's as simple as including this within your project.

```csharp
using ItemRarities.Enums;
using ItemRarities.Managers;

internal sealed class Mod : MelonMod
{
    public override void OnInitializeMelon()
    {
        RarityManager.AddGearItemAndRarity("GEAR_ExampleItem", Rarities.Mythic);
        RarityManager.AddGearItemAndRarity("GEAR_ExampleItem2", Rarities.Legendary);
    }
}
```
